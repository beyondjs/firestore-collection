# Considerations for Naming Subcollections

When designing the structure of collections and subcollections in Firestore, it's important to be aware of certain
limitations that can affect the way you access nested data. One such limitation is related to the naming of
subcollections in a hierarchical data model.

Careful planning of the Firestore data model is essential. The requirement for unique collection and subcollection names
within the `params.parents` object must be taken into account to ensure a smooth development process and to prevent
issues with data retrieval. By following these best practices, you can design a robust and scalable Firestore structure
that avoids the pitfalls of naming collisions.

## Limitation of Identical Subcollection Names

The `params.parents` object, which is of type `Record<string, string>`, is used to map parent collection names to their
document IDs. Since object keys in JavaScript (and by extension, TypeScript) must be unique, this presents a limitation:
you cannot have multiple parent collections or subcollections with the same name at different levels of the hierarchy.

For instance, consider the following hierarchy:

`Users -> Posts -> Comments -> Comments -> Likes`

In this structure, there are two subcollections named `Comments`. If you were to use a `Record<string, string>` to
specify the parents for the `Likes` subcollection, you would not be able to distinguish between the two `Comments`
subcollections because they have the same name. The record could only store one entry for `Comments`, thus leading to
ambiguity and potential data access issues.

## Best Practices for Naming

To avoid this limitation, it is crucial to design your Firestore structure with unique names for each collection and
subcollection within the hierarchy. Here are some best practices to consider:

-   **Unique Naming**: Ensure each collection and subcollection has a unique name within the context of its parent.
    Instead of having two `Comments` subcollections, you could name them differently to reflect their level or purpose,
    such as `PostComments` and `CommentReplies`.
-   **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names that indicate the subcollection's relationship to its parent. For
    example, `UserPosts` and `PostComments` are more descriptive and help to avoid naming conflicts.

-   **Flattening Structures**: In some cases, it might be beneficial to flatten the hierarchy to reduce complexity.
    Instead of deeply nested subcollections, consider using a shallower structure with more descriptive collection
    names.

-   **Using Prefixes or Suffixes**: Incorporate prefixes or suffixes to distinguish between similar subcollections. For
    instance, `InitialComments` and `ReplyComments` could serve to differentiate two types of comments within the data
    model.
